# Template-Method-Pattern
Software Design and Architecture Template Method Pattern

You are expected to implement a program that builds a computer for different purposes
using Template Method pattern. Your program needs to able to build two types of computers Gaming
and Office. CPU, Memory and type of storage depends on the computer type.
For a gaming computer you need to put:
∗ High-end multi-core cpu
∗ High-clock speed memory
∗ SSD storage
For an office computer you need to put:
∗ Low-end dual-core cpu
∗ Energy-efficient memory
∗ Energy-efficient HDD
However, way you build a computer is a set of pre-determined steps:
∗ Plug CPU
∗ Plug Memory
∗ Plug Storage
∗ Plug peripherals (which are common for both type of computer)
